# Real-Time Web @cmda-minor-web Â· 2019-2020

**This repository contains an overview of all my exercise files for the [Real-time Web course][course-repo]. Since we will be building a different application in the first week to get some hands on experience using web sockets and another application later on, I added both as submodules to this repository.**

For both projects, a short description and a link to the relevant demo and submodule are provided below.

## First Assignment - Basic Chat Application
This first week we started off building a simple real-time chat application using sockets.io.

- [Repository][code-week-1]
- [Demo][demo-week-1]


## Second Assignment - The Wiki Game
The next few weeks, I have been working on an application that uses web sockets to have users compete by trying to navigate to destinations on wikipedia as fast as possible. This second application combines an API providing real-time data with web sockets connecting players and a database where the average amount of clicks is saved for eacht destination.
