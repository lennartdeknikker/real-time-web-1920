# Real-Time Web @cmda-minor-web · 2019-2020

**This repository contains an overview of all my exercise files for the [Real-time Web course][course-repo]. Since we will be building a different application in the first week to get some hands on experience using web sockets and another application later on, I added both as submodules to this repository.**

For both projects, a short description and a link to the relevant demo and submodule are provided below.

## Week 1 - Basic Chat Application
This first week we started off building a simple real-time chat application using sockets.io.
